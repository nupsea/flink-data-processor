### Example Dataset: Books Data

Throughout this guide, we will be using a dataset related to books. This dataset will help illustrate various Flink concepts and demonstrate how to apply Flink in real-world data engineering scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the chapters, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of data engineering concepts.
- Familiarity with Java or Scala, as Flink applications are typically written in these languages.
- An environment setup for Flink development (instructions provided in Chapter 0).
